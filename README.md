# Safe Shell

**AI-powered safety layer for your terminal.** Intercepts commands, analyzes risk, and blocks dangerous actions before they run.

## ⚡ Setup

1.  **Install Dependencies**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
2.  **Configure Environment**
    Create a `.env` file with your Gemini API key:
    ```env
    GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
    ```
3.  **Activate**
    Source the integration script (add to `~/.zshrc` for persistence):
    ```zsh
    source safe_shell.sh
    ```

## 🚀 Usage

Just use your terminal as normal. Safe Shell runs silently in the background.

- **Safe Commands**: Run instantly.
  ```bash
  echo "Hello"  # ✅ Runs immediately
  ```
- **Risky Commands**: Prompt for confirmation.
  ```bash
  npm install   # ⚠️  Ask: Execute? [y/N]
  ```
- **Dangerous Commands**: Blocked by default.
  ```bash
  rm -rf /      # 🚫 BLOCKED (Can be forced with 'y')
  ```
